## Releasing

- Bump version in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml)
- Switch to a new branch `git switch -c rel/<VERSION>`
- Make a commit `git commit -am "Prepare for <VERSION>"`
- Make an annotated tag `git tag <VERSION> -am <MESSAGE>`.
- Push the changes `git push --follow-tags` and GH actions should deploy the package to *Test PyPI*.
- Merge the branch
- Run the [manual deploy workflow (see the "Run workflow" button)](https://github.com/ashwinvis/myst-reader/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml) to copy the release to the main PyPI.
